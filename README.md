# Brainfuck Programs

Welcome to the **Brainfuck Programs** repository! This repository is dedicated to code written in the Brainfuck programming language, including examples like "Hello World" and simple programs such as pattern printing and more.

## About Brainfuck

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. It is known for its extreme minimalism, using only eight commands. Despite its simplicity, Brainfuck is Turing complete and capable of implementing any algorithm that can be executed on a Turing machine.

### Brainfuck Commands

- `>` : Increment the data pointer (move right).
- `<` : Decrement the data pointer (move left).
- `+` : Increment the byte at the data pointer.
- `-` : Decrement the byte at the data pointer.
- `.` : Output the byte at the data pointer.
- `,` : Input a byte and store it at the data pointer.
- `[` : Jump forward to the command after `]` if the byte at the data pointer is 0.
- `]` : Jump back to the command after `[` if the byte at the data pointer is not 0.

## Programs
